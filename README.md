## Projects Overview  

### 1. Titanic Survival Prediction  
In this project, I built a predictive model to determine the survival of passengers on the Titanic using Machine Learning techniques. The model uses various features of passengers to predict whether they survived or not.  

**Technologies Used:**  
- Python  
- Machine Learning Libraries (e.g., Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy)  
- Data Visualization Libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)  

**Key Steps Involved:**  
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for modeling.  
- Feature Engineering: Selecting and transforming features to improve model performance.  
- Model Selection: Testing various models and selecting the best-performing one.  
- Evaluation: Measuring model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, etc.  

### 2. Movie Rating Prediction  
This project focuses on predicting movie ratings using Logistic Regression, a powerful algorithm for classification tasks.  

**Technologies Used:**  
- Python  
- Logistic Regression (from Scikit-learn)  
- Data Science Libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy)  

**Key Steps Involved:**  
- Data Collection: Gathering movie data with ratings.  
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.  
- Model Training: Implementing Logistic Regression for prediction.  
- Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance with appropriate metrics.

### 3. Credit Card Detection  
In this project, I developed a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using the Isolation Forest algorithm, which is effective for anomaly detection.  

**Technologies Used:**  
- Python  
- Isolation Forest Algorithm (from Scikit-learn)  
- Data Science Libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy)  

**Key Steps Involved:**  
- Data Collection: Acquiring a dataset of credit card transactions.  
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for modeling.  
- Anomaly Detection: Implementing the Isolation Forest algorithm to identify potential fraud.  
- Evaluation: Assessing model performance using relevant evaluation metrics.
